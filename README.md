# PROJECT NAME
Voice Contolled Personal Assistant Using Raspberry Pi

## OVERVIEW
It is a Voice Controlled System, Where User gives input as Voice and receives desired output also as Voice. The main moto of this project is to help Visually impaired person to get Connected to the outer world, by giving them access Wikipedia, calculator, email and music all through their voice. In total acting as a Personal Assistant.


## PROBLEM STATEMENT
Visually impaired person can't give text input to get any source of information which they are in need of, Therefore have to be dependent on others.
